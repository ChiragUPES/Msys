My name is Chirag Goel. Basically I am from haryana and currently pursuing B.tech in CSE specialization in Cyber Security and Forensics.Talking about my technical skills
I have developed projects both in development as well as security field. Next coming to my hooobies I Love to play badminton and this lock down helps me in finding
one more thing in myself . Actually I loves to do poetry as well. Talking about my strength and weakness. The weakness which I fell in myself is that whenever i am 
going to learn new concept which is different for me it takes sometime for me to digest that concept and talking about my strengths the one and only strength which 
I believe in myself is that I beleive in God only.
